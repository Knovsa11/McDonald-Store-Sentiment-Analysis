# McDonald-Store-Sentiment-Analysis

This project predicts McDonald's customer reviews' positive and negative sentiments based on the service provided. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis predictions. The model achieved an accuracy of 80%.

## Project Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of McDonald's customer reviews as positive or negative. This classification helps McDonald's understand customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.

## Problem Statement
Understanding customer sentiment is crucial for businesses like McDonald's to maintain and improve their service quality. However, manually analyzing large volumes of customer reviews is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project addresses this issue by automating the sentiment analysis process using NLP and machine learning techniques.

## Background
Customer reviews provide valuable insights into their experiences and satisfaction levels. Positive reviews highlight strengths, while negative reviews point out areas needing attention. Accurately classifying these reviews enables businesses to respond proactively to customer feedback, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Project Output
The output of this project includes:
A trained machine learning model that classifies McDonald's customer reviews as positive or negative.
Predictions on new customer review data.
Deployment URLs for the model and saved model files.

## Methods
The project utilizes the following methods:
Feature Engineering: Extracting and selecting features from the text data.
Modeling: Building and training the machine learning model for sentiment analysis.
Model Inference: Testing the trained model on new review data to make sentiment predictions.

## Technology Stack
The project is developed using the following technologies:

Programming Language: Python

Data Analysis and Manipulation: Pandas

Natural Language Processing: NLTK, Scikit-learn, etc
